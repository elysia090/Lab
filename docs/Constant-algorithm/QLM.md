Phenotype AI: constant-size representation-to-learning via QMS-256 and a filtered dgLA Cech backbone

Abstract
We present a peer-review-grade, end-to-end stack whose online cost per token is constant and independent of expression depth and cover size. Inputs are byte streams encoded by QMS-256 into a projective SU(2) state with optional SL(2,C) spikes and idempotent normalization, then lifted to local 0-forms. Gluing and differentiation are governed by a filtered, complete differential graded Lie algebra (dgLA) of graded derivations on the total complex of a finite good cover. A degree-1 Maurer–Cartan element mu (Robin transmission) yields a square-zero total differential D_mu = D + mu, and a filtered homological perturbation produces a bounded contraction to de Rham cohomology. With fixed offline operator envelopes, all forward-, reverse-, and mixed-mode Jacobian products execute in O(1). We provide explicit hypotheses, constants, proofs (sketches), error bounds, and a minimal ABI.
	0.	Conventions and computation model
Spaces are complex Banach or Hilbert scales H^s(U_S;Lambda^p) with bounded restrictions. Operator norms ||·|| are taken on the chosen scales. A finite good cover U={U_i} has overlap multiplicity nu. A band-limit K bounds local representation size. The online model is a unit-cost RAM with fixed-size complex dense linear algebra; a single 2x2 complex multiply is O(1). All O(1) statements mean independence from token length T, number of patches P, and expression depth.
	1.	Total complex and filtered dgLA
Manifold and cover
Let M be paracompact C^infty, and U a finite good cover. For p,q>=0 define
C^q(U;Omega^p) = product_{|S|=q+1} Omega^p(U_S), U_S = intersection_{i in S} U_i.
Tot^N = direct sum_{p+q=N} C^q(U;Omega^p), Tot = direct sum_{N>=0} Tot^N.

Total differential
Let d be the exterior derivative and delta the Cech coboundary. On form degree p set delta_tot := (-1)^p delta. Define D := d + delta_tot.

dgLA of derivations
Let Der(Tot) be graded derivations of Tot with graded commutator [A,B] = A B - (-1)^{|A||B|} B A. The differential is ad_D = [D, ·]; then (Der(Tot), [·,·], ad_D) is a dgLA.

Filtered completeness
Equip Der(Tot) with a complete Hausdorff descending filtration F^m by (Cech degree) + (local operator order) so that F^1 is pronilpotent and complete. Convergence is in the filtered norm ||·||_F.
	2.	QMS-256 front end (degree-0 functor)
State and charts
Maintain psi in C^2 \ {0}. Use dual charts z = u/v and z’ = v/u. Select the chart with |den| >= tau_den. Normalization e fixes ||psi||=1 and a phase; e(e(psi)) = e(psi). The Jacobian of e is a bounded projector on C^2 \ {0}.

Byte-to-SU(2)
A fixed 256-entry LUT maps b in {0..255} to q_b (unit quaternion). Embed q = w + x i + y j + z k to SU(2) via
a := w + i z, bq := x + i y, U(q) = [[a, bq], [-conj(bq), conj(a)]].
Per token: psi <- e(U(q_b) psi).

Optional spikes
Finite set {S_ell} subset SL(2,C). If a 1-bit gate is on, apply psi <- e(S_ell psi). All actions are degree 0.

Lift into local forms
For each patch U_i, choose basis {phi_{i,k}}_{k=1..K} subset Omega^0(U_i) and bounded linear C_i in C^{Kx2}. Set psi_i = C_i psi.

Exact decode
Store b per token and return it for exact inversion.

Operator envelopes
Unitary U(q_b) have ||U||=1. Record b_S >= sup_ell sup_s ||exp(s G_ell)|| for S_ell = exp(s G_ell). Record c_lift >= sup_i ||C_i||. These are offline constants.
	3.	Degree-0 actions, gauge, and BCH
Let g^0 subset Der^0(Tot) be generated by L_X (Lie derivative), J_c (degree-0 incidence actions), lift operators, and QMS blocks. Degree-0 flows act by gauge on Maurer–Cartan data. For Theta in g^0,
mu |-> mu^Theta := e^{ad_Theta} mu - (e^{ad_Theta}-1) ad_Theta^{-1} [D,Theta].
The degree-0 subgroup exp(g^0) factorizes by BCH into commuting exponentials for L_X and J_c (and constant-size blocks for QMS); reordering is uniform and constant-size.
	4.	Robin transmission as a Maurer–Cartan element
Definition (Maurer–Cartan)
mu in Der^1(Tot) is MC if ad_D mu + (1/2)[mu,mu] = 0. Then D_mu := D + mu satisfies D_mu^2 = 0.

Concrete mu (Robin form)
On q=0, for psi=(psi_i)i and overlaps U{ij},
(mu psi){ij} := alpha (psi_i - psi_j) + beta{ij} L_X (psi_i + psi_j),
extended to Tot as a derivation. Here alpha>0, beta_{ij}>0, and X is a bounded vector field.

Cartan identities
iota_X has degree -1, L_X = [d,iota_X] degree 0. On Tot, [delta_tot, iota_X] = 0, hence [D, iota_X] = L_X. These identities pass to D_mu by the MC condition.

Edge curvature identity
On homogeneous form degree p, the q:0->2 component of D_mu^2 = 0 is
delta_tot (alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi) + mu (alpha E psi + beta L_X S psi) + [d, mu] psi = 0,
where E,S are edge difference/sum derivations and [d,mu] = [L_X, alpha E + beta S] on q=0.
	5.	Filtered homological perturbation and bounds
Contraction data
Let (iota, pi, h) be a bounded contraction between (Omega^(M), d) and (Tot^, D): pi iota = id, iota pi = id - D h - h D.

Convergence condition
Let gamma := ||h|| * ||mu||_F. Assume gamma < 1.

Perturbed homotopy
h_mu := h sum_{m>=0} (- mu h)^m converges in the filtered norm. Then (iota, pi, h_mu) is a contraction between (Omega^, d) and (Tot^, D_mu).

Truncation error
Truncating at order m yields a tail tau_m <= gamma^{m+1} / (1 - gamma). All constants are independent of P and expression depth.
	6.	Differentiation templates (constant-size)
Blocks
Linear: U(q_b), S_ell, e, C_i, D_mu, iota_X, L_X, J_c, iota, pi, h_mu. Pointwise: smooth gates and bounded Phi_k operating componentwise on local coordinates.

JVP
Apply graded derivation rules; reorder degree-0 blocks by the BCH split; multiply constant-size matrices. For parameter t affecting mu,
d h_mu / d t = - h S ( d mu / d t h ) S with S := sum_{m>=0} (- mu h)^m, truncated at fixed m.

VJP and HVP
Replace each block by its adjoint; use h_mu^* with the same truncation. Composition yields HVP. All costs are constant-size.
	7.	Learnable parameter manifolds and feasibility
Parameters
theta_R: alpha = exp(a), beta_{ij} = exp(b_{ij}), X = sum_r w_r X_r.
theta_QMS: SU(2) conjugation Q = exp(A) with A in su(2); spikes S_ell = exp(s_ell G_ell) with gates s_ell in [0,1], tau >= tau_min; lift maps C_i (optionally with Stiefel constraints).

Feasible set and barrier
Define rho_eff := ||h|| * ( alpha ||E|| + ||beta|| ||S|| ||L_X|| ), using offline envelopes for ||E||, ||S||, ||L_X||, and ||beta||. Feasible F = { rho_eff < 1 }. Use barrier B(theta) = -log(1 - rho_eff(theta)) and project to F after each step. All checks are constant-size.

Gradients (constant-size)
d mu / d alpha = E
d mu / d beta_{ij} = P_{ij} L_X S
d mu / d w_r = beta L_{X_r} S
d U’ / d A [Delta] = [Delta, U’] at A near 0; use Lie integral otherwise
d S_ell / d s_ell = G_ell exp(s_ell G_ell)
All Jacobians and adjoints are 2x2 or Kx2 blocks with fixed envelopes.
	8.	Complexity and correctness
Theorem (algebraic soundness)
If mu solves the MC equation, then D_mu^2 = 0 and [D_mu, iota_X] = L_X, [D_mu, L_X] = 0.

Theorem (filtered HPL)
Under gamma < 1, (iota, pi, h_mu) is a contraction; truncation tail tau_m <= gamma^{m+1}/(1 - gamma).

Theorem (constant-time AD)
Fix nu, K, p_max, and truncation m. Any expression generated by the blocks above has JVP, VJP, and HVP that execute with a constant number of constant-size multiplies; time and memory are O(1) per token and independent of P and expression depth.
	9.	Numerical stability
Dual-chart policy with threshold tau_den prevents denominator underflow; e is idempotent, nonexpansive off the origin, and has a bounded adjoint. Unitary U(q_b) imply condition number 1; spikes obey recorded spectral bounds b_S; lift maps are bounded by c_lift. Finite precision is handled by chart switching, rescaling, and optional clipping of spike parameters.
	10.	Minimal ABI
init_qms(LUT, {S_ell}, e, {C_i}, tau_den, tau_min)
init_cech(E, S, L_X, {J_c}, iota, pi, h, truncation_m, envelopes)
forward_token(b, flags, psi_in) -> (psi_out, {psi_i})
jvp_token(b, flags, psi, v) -> outputs
vjp_token(b, flags, psi, adj) -> outputs
update_params(grad_theta) with retractions and projection to F
certify(theta) -> pass/fail
	11.	Worked micro-example
M = S^1, two patches U_1, U_2, K = 1. mu on overlaps is scalar. Per byte: one SU(2) multiply, optional spike, normalization, two lifts. D_mu curvature identity reduces to a single overlap equation. JVP/VJP/HVP are visible as compositions of constant-size blocks.
	12.	Reproducibility checklist
Cover and bases; nu, K, p_max. Tables and adjoints for E, S, L_X, J_c; contraction (iota, pi, h); truncation m and tail bound. QMS LUT b -> q_b (or a finite subgroup Cayley table), matrices U(q_b), spikes, normalization e, lifts C_i with adjoints. Operator envelopes for certification. Reference kernels and tests including pole-near cases and gating extremes.
	13.	Limitations
O(1) guarantees assume fixed good cover pattern, fixed K and p_max, bounded Phi_k derivatives, and rho_eff < 1. Nonlocal nonlinearities must factor through degree-0 incidence to keep templates closed. The finite-subgroup option trades angular resolution for exact algebraic closure.

Proof sketches for key identities
	1.	[delta_tot, iota_X] = 0: delta_tot acts on Cech indices with sign (-1)^p; iota_X acts on forms; degrees commute, so graded sign cancels. Hence [D, iota_X] = [d, iota_X] = L_X.
	2.	[d, mu] on q=0: d is a derivation and L_X = [d, iota_X] gives [d, alpha E] = 0, [d, beta L_X S] = [L_X, beta S]; extend derivationally to all q. The MC equation ad_D mu + (1/2)[mu,mu] = 0 expands to the edge identity written above.
	3.	Filtered HPL: with gamma < 1, S = sum_{m>=0} (- mu h)^m converges in ||·||_F; define h_mu = h S and verify the contraction identities by formal power series, then bound the truncation tail by the geometric series.



Appendix X: Band-limited scalar fields on S^2 (Riemann sphere) with point impulses, in ASCII

Purpose
	•	Define an exact, implementation-ready recipe to visualize band-limited scalar fields on S^2 together with point-like impulses.
	•	Keep all notation ASCII. Tie the construction to the QMS-256 front end and constant-size updates.

A. Coordinates and maps

A1. S^2 basics
	•	Use unit vectors n = (nx, ny, nz) with ||n|| = 1.
	•	Spherical angles: theta in [0, pi], phi in [0, 2*pi).
nx = sin(theta) * cos(phi)
ny = sin(theta) * sin(phi)
nz = cos(theta)

A2. Riemann sphere (stereographic from north pole)
	•	Complex plane coordinate z in C union {inf}.
	•	Map z -> n:
let r2 = |z|^2
nx = 2Re(z) / (1 + r2)
ny = 2Im(z) / (1 + r2)
nz = (r2 - 1) / (1 + r2)
	•	Inverse n -> z (excluding south pole):
z = (nx + i*ny) / (1 + nz)

A3. Hopf map from normalized spinor psi to S^2
	•	Let psi = (u, v) in C^2 with |u|^2 + |v|^2 = 1.
	•	Unit vector n = (nx, ny, nz) given by:
nx = 2Re(uconj(v))
ny = 2Im(uconj(v))
nz = |u|^2 - |v|^2
	•	This ties QMS-256 state psi to a point on S^2.

B. Band-limited scalar fields via spherical harmonics

B1. Basis Y_lm
	•	Use real or complex spherical harmonics. Here: complex Y_lm:
Y_lm(theta, phi) = N_lm * P_l^|m|(cos(theta)) * exp(imphi)
N_lm = sqrt( (2l+1)/(4pi) * ( (l-|m|)! / (l+|m|)! ) )
l = 0..L, m = -l..l
	•	P_l^m are associated Legendre functions. Precompute them on a theta grid.

B2. Expansion and band-limit
	•	A band-limited scalar field f: S^2 -> R (or C) with limit L:
f(n) = sum_{l=0..L} sum_{m=-l..l} a_{l m} * Y_lm(theta, phi)
	•	Coefficients a_{l m} define the field. Store as a packed vector.

B3. Rotation action (for degree-0 flows)
	•	A rotation R in SO(3) acts on coefficients by Wigner-D blocks:
a’{l m} = sum{m’=-l..l} D^l_{m m’}(R) * a_{l m’}
	•	With QMS-256, SU(2) matrix U induces R = Ad(U). Precompute D^l(R) for l=0..L or tabulate small-angle generators and use BCH if needed.

C. Point impulses and kernels

C1. Band-limited delta at n0
	•	The ideal delta on S^2 at n0 is not band-limited. Its best L-bandlimited proxy uses the addition theorem:
Let gamma be the geodesic angle between n and n0, i.e. cos(gamma) = n dot n0.
Define
delta_L(n, n0) = sum_{l=0..L} (2l+1)/(4pi) * P_l( cos(gamma) )
	•	Properties:
	•	Integral over S^2 is 1 (exact for all L).
	•	As L increases, delta_L concentrates around n0 with main-lobe width ~ pi/L.

C2. Heat kernel (spherical Gaussian) for smoothing
	•	Coefficients multiplier:
g_l(t) = exp( - t * l * (l+1) ) , t > 0
	•	Smoothed field:
a_{l m}^{(t)} = g_l(t) * a_{l m}
	•	This preserves band-limit and damps high l.

C3. Building impulses in coefficient space
	•	Given location n0 with angles (theta0, phi0):
a_{l m}^{impulse} = (2l+1)/(4pi) * Y_lm^*(theta0, phi0)
	•	Then f(n) = sum_{l,m} a_{l m}^{impulse} * Y_lm(theta, phi) equals delta_L(n, n0).

D. Grids, sampling, and offline tables

D1. Grids
	•	Use an O(L^2) grid. Two common choices:
	•	Equiangular: theta_i = pi*(i+0.5)/N_theta, phi_j = 2pij/N_phi, with N_theta,N_phi ~ 2*L.
	•	Gauss-Legendre in theta with N_theta ~ L+1, and uniform phi with N_phi ~ 2*L+1.

D2. Offline precomputation
	•	Precompute and store:
	•	Y_lm(theta_i, phi_j) for all l<=L, m in [-l..l], grid points (i,j).
	•	P_l(c) for c in a fine grid on [-1,1] (for impulse via P_l(cos gamma)).
	•	Wigner D^l blocks for rotations induced by QMS SU(2) steps you actually use.
	•	Heat multipliers g_l(t) for t in a small certified set.

E. Coupling to QMS-256

E1. From psi to a moving impulse
	•	Convert psi -> n0 via Hopf map (A3).
	•	Add a weighted impulse centered at n0:
a_{l m} += w * (2l+1)/(4pi) * Y_lm^*(theta0, phi0)
	•	If a spike S_ell fires, use its gate s in [0,1] for amplitude or for a short blur with g_l(t_s).

E2. Rotating a field by a byte
	•	Each token b applies U(q_b) in SU(2) to psi and induces an SO(3) rotation R_b on the field:
for each l: a_l <- D^l(R_b) * a_l
	•	This keeps the band-limit fixed and is constant-size once D^l are small and pretabulated up to L.

E3. Constant-size pattern
	•	L is fixed offline. For small L (e.g., L <= 8 or 16), all Wigner D^l are tiny blocks.
	•	Per token: a handful of  (2l+1)x(2l+1) multiplies for l=0..L, plus optional impulse add (rank-1 update), plus optional heat kernel scaling. This stays constant-time for fixed L.

F. Rendering to ASCII

F1. Scalar to ASCII shade
	•	Choose intensity mapping s -> char:
map s_norm in [0,1] to “ .:-=+*#%@”
	•	Normalize per-frame or globally:
s_norm = (s - s_min) / (s_max - s_min + eps)

F2. Lat-long raster (rows by theta, cols by phi)
	•	For i in 0..N_theta-1:
theta = pi*(i+0.5)/N_theta
row = “”
for j in 0..N_phi-1:
phi = 2pij/N_phi
s = sum_{l,m} a_{l m} * Y_lm(theta, phi)   ; or use precomputed table dot a
row += shade(s)
print(row)

F3. Minimal pseudocode (Python-like, ASCII only)

def ylm_table(L, theta_grid, phi_grid):
    # returns dict[(l,m)] -> 2D array Y_lm(theta_i, phi_j)
    # precompute associated Legendre and exp(i m phi)
    ...

def impulse_coeffs(L, theta0, phi0):
    # a_{l m} = (2l+1)/(4*pi) * conj(Y_lm(theta0,phi0))
    a = {}
    for l in range(L+1):
        for m in range(-l, l+1):
            a[(l,m)] = (2*l+1)/(4.0*pi) * conj(Y_lm_scalar(l,m,theta0,phi0))
    return a

def rotate_coeffs(a, D_blocks):  # D_blocks: dict[l] -> (2l+1)x(2l+1) matrix
    a_rot = {}
    for l, D in D_blocks.items():
        vec = [a.get((l,m),0.0+0.0j) for m in range(-l,l+1)]
        vec2 = D @ vec
        for idx,m in enumerate(range(-l,l+1)):
            a_rot[(l,m)] = vec2[idx]
    return a_rot

def heat_filter(a, t):
    a2 = {}
    for (l,m), c in a.items():
        a2[(l,m)] = exp(-t*l*(l+1))*c
    return a2

def render_ascii(a, Y_table, N_theta, N_phi, chars=" .:-=+*#%@"):
    import numpy as np
    S = np.zeros((N_theta, N_phi), dtype=float)
    for (l,m), Ylm in Y_table.items():
        S += (a.get((l,m),0.0+0.0j)).real * Ylm.real - (a.get((l,m),0.0+0.0j)).imag * Ylm.imag
    smin, smax = S.min(), S.max()
    out = []
    for i in range(N_theta):
        row = ""
        for j in range(N_phi):
            x = (S[i,j]-smin)/max(1e-12, smax-smin)
            k = min(len(chars)-1, int(x*(len(chars)-1)+0.5))
            row += chars[k]
        out.append(row)
    return "\n".join(out)

G. Sanity checks

G1. Energy and orthogonality
	•	With complex Y_lm normalized as in B1:
Integral_{S^2} Y_lm * conj(Y_l’m’) dOmega = delta_{l l’} delta_{m m’}
Then ||f||^2 = sum_{l,m} |a_{l m}|^2.

G2. Impulse at the north pole
	•	For n0 = (0,0,1), theta0 = 0:
Y_lm(theta0,phi0) = 0 for m != 0; Y_l0(theta0,phi0) = sqrt((2l+1)/(4pi))
Hence a_{l0} = (2l+1)/(4pi) * sqrt((2l+1)/(4pi)), and rendering should show a circularly symmetric peak.

G3. Rotation consistency
	•	Apply a rotation R to coefficients via Wigner D. Rendering should equal rotating the image on the sphere. Numerically test by sampling f(R^{-1} n) vs rendered f’(n).

H. Numerical notes

H1. Band-limit vs grid
	•	Use N_theta ~ 2L and N_phi ~ 2L to avoid aliasing on equiangular grids. For higher accuracy in integration, increase N_phi.

H2. Stability near poles
	•	Use dual charts for stereographic or just stay in (theta, phi). For impulses, use the Legendre sum delta_L; do not sample a true delta.

H3. Fixed-size execution
	•	For a fixed L, all blocks (Wigner D^l, Y_lm tables, heat multipliers) are fixed-size. Adding a single impulse is a rank-1 update in coefficient space.

I. Minimal QMS-driven visualization loop (constant-size per token)

 Offline (fixed size for chosen L)
Y_table = ylm_table(L, theta_grid, phi_grid)
D_blocks = precompute_wigner_D_blocks(L, set_of_R_from_QMS)
a = zeros_like_coeffs(L)

 Online per token b
psi = normalize( U(q_b) @ psi )
if spike_flag:
    (theta0, phi0) = hopf_to_angles(psi)
    a += w * impulse_coeffs(L, theta0, phi0)     # rank-1 add
if apply_rotation_to_field:
    Rb = so3_from_su2(U(q_b))
    a = rotate_coeffs(a, D_blocks[Rb])           # block-wise multiply
if apply_heat:
    a = heat_filter(a, t_step)

 Render occasionally
ascii_frame = render_ascii(a, Y_table, N_theta, N_phi)
print(ascii_frame)

J. Compact reference
	•	Stereographic map (A2)
	•	Hopf map (A3)
	•	Spherical harmonics basis (B1)
	•	Band-limited delta kernel (C1)
	•	Heat kernel multiplier (C2)
	•	Rotation in coefficient space via Wigner D (B3)
	•	ASCII renderer (F2/F3)


Summary
The stack uses a filtered complete dgLA to make square-zero structure and differentiation first-class invariants, and QMS-256 to supply a constant-size, exact, and bounded front end. With explicit envelopes and filtered control, all online passes are O(1), algebraically closed, and numerically stable. This formulation isolates assumptions, quantifies errors, and exposes a minimal ABI suitable for independent verification.
